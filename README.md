### Problem Statement
To develop a recommender system that will help  the restaurant manager to find the best suitable  place to open an Coffee Shop!

### Target Audience
Target audience for this system are the managers or  people who want to open an Coffee Shop in the  specific city or area. These people expect the place  which is most popular and well known in the city.

### Data Collection:
To open a shop, following things are required –

▫	Geographical coordinates of the area

▫	The population of the neighbourhood

▫	The type of people in the neighbourhood

▫	Average income of the people nearby that area

▫	The preference of people towards the type of food

▫	Other service details such as juice, transport, taxi, etc.


The above information was obtained from the various websites such
as Wikipedia, Foursquare API, census report websites, csv data, etc.

### Recommendation
By analyzing nearby venues, we can conclude that the cluster 1  does not have many Coffee shops in that	areas. Thus, it  would be suitable to select these locations for opening ice  cream shops.
Therefore, locations like Central Bay Street, Riverdale, The  Beaches West, Commerce court will be good to open a new Ice  Cream Shop.
